# Microsoft Kiota API Client Generator Example

Welcome to the **Microsoft Kiota API Client Generator** sample! This project demonstrates how to generate strongly-typed API clients from OpenAPI specifications using Microsoft's Kiota tool, showcasing a modern approach to consuming REST APIs in .NET applications.

This repo is an example for the blog post [Build better C# API Clients: OpenAPI and Kiota](https://baundev.com/posts/api-clients-kiota/). It illustrates how to generate a client for the Swagger Petstore API and use it in a .NET console application.

## Key Features

-   Generation of strongly-typed C# client code from OpenAPI specifications
-   Type-safe API interactions with IntelliSense support
-   Clean API consumption using the builder pattern
-   Automatic serialization/deserialization of requests and responses

## Project Structure

-   **ApiClientKiota.Client**: Contains the Kiota-generated API client and models
-   **ApiClientKiota.Console**: Simple console app demonstrating the API client usage
-   **Resources**: Contains the OpenAPI specification file (petstore-openapi.json)
